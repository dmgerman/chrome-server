;;; Commentary:

;; Optional browsel module that routes URLs from Emacs to a connected
;; browser via the WebSocket bridge.  Drop-in `browsel-browse-url' is
;; compatible with `browse-url-browser-function', so any Emacs command
;; that opens a URL (org links, eww, mu4e, dired, …) can be made to go
;; through browsel.
;;
;; Routing is configured in `browsel-url-routes' as an ordered list of
;; plists: each entry maps a URL pattern to a client, an
;; incognito flag, and an optional separate match used to detect when
;; the URL is "already open" in some tab.  First match in the list
;; wins; URLs that match nothing fall through to
;; `browsel-default-client', non-incognito.
;;
;; A route's `:client' may be the string \"eww\" (or
;; `browsel-default-client' itself may be \"eww\") to render the URL
;; inside Emacs with eww instead of dispatching to a connected
;; browser.  No WS bridge call is made in that case; buffer reuse is
;; left to `eww-reuse-buffers'.
;;
;; When an existing matching tab is found (under the route's incognito
;; constraint), the function focuses it and raises the browser window.
;; Otherwise a fresh tab is opened — in an incognito window for
;; incognito routes, or via plain OPEN_TAB for the rest.
;;
;; Example configuration:
;;
;;   (setq browsel-url-routes
;;         '((:pattern "\\`https?://\\(www\\.\\)?github\\.com/"
;;            :client  "chrome")
;;           (:pattern "\\`https?://app\\.slack\\.com/"
;;            :client  "chrome"
;;            :tab-match "\\`https?://app\\.slack\\.com/")
;;           (:pattern "\\`https?://news\\."
;;            :client  "firefox"
;;            :incognito t)))
;;
;;   ;; Route every URL Emacs opens through browsel:
;;   (setq browse-url-browser-function #'browsel-browse-url)
;;
;; Incognito caveat: opening an incognito tab requires the user to
;; toggle "Allow in incognito" for the browsel extension in
;; `chrome://extensions' (or the Firefox equivalent).  When the toggle
;; is off the extension cannot enumerate or create incognito windows;
;; `browsel-browse-url' detects the failure, warns, and falls back to
;; a normal (non-incognito) tab so the user still reaches the page.

(defcustom browsel-url-routes nil
  "Ordered list of URL routing rules for `browsel-browse-url'.

Each element is a plist with these keys:

  :pattern REGEX
    Regular expression matched against the full URL.  The match is
    a substring match (anywhere in the URL) — leading/trailing `.*'
    is redundant.  Anchor explicitly with `\\\\=`' and `\\\\='' if a
    strict whole-string match is wanted.

    Convention: include a trailing `/' on host patterns (e.g.
    `\"uvic\\\\.ca/\"' rather than `\"uvic\\\\.ca\"') so a stray
    occurrence of the host string inside a query parameter of some
    other URL doesn't false-match.

    The first matching entry in the list wins.

  :client CLIENT-NAME
    String — the browsel client to address (e.g. \"chrome\" or
    \"firefox\").  Must name a currently-connected client.
    May also be the string \"eww\", in which case the URL is opened
    in Emacs with `eww' and the WS bridge is not used.  When
    `:client' is \"eww\", `:incognito' and `:tab-match' are ignored;
    buffer reuse is governed by `eww-reuse-buffers'.

  :incognito BOOL
    Optional.  When non-nil, the tab is opened in an incognito /
    private window.  Requires the user to have toggled \"Allow in
    incognito\" on the browsel extension; without that toggle the
    extension cannot create or even enumerate incognito windows,
    `browsel-browse-url' detects the failure, warns once, and
    falls back to a normal tab.

  :tab-match REGEX
    Optional override for the already-open detection.  When set,
    this regex is matched against the tab URLs returned by
    `GET_ALL_TABS'.  Without this key the tab match defaults to
    \"the tab URL must contain the requested URL\" (regexp-quoted),
    independent of `:pattern' — routing (which client) and tab
    matching (which open tab) are separate concerns.

URLs that match no entry fall through to `browsel-default-client',
non-incognito, with identical-URL match."

(defun browsel-browse-url (url &rest _ignored)
  "Open URL in a browser via browsel, honoring `browsel-url-routes'.

Two separate concerns:

  (a) ROUTING — which client to send the URL to.  The first route
      in `browsel-url-routes' whose `:pattern' matches URL provides
      the client and incognito flag.  No route matches →
      `browsel-default-client', non-incognito.  When the resolved
      client is the string \"eww\", the URL is opened in Emacs with
      `eww' and the rest of this docstring (tab matching, incognito,
      window raising) does not apply.

  (b) TAB MATCHING — whether to focus an already-open tab or open
      a new one.  By default the tab URL must fully contain the
      requested URL: a sub-page of the requested URL still counts
      (requesting `https://github.com/x/y' focuses a tab on
      `https://github.com/x/y/issues/3'), but an unrelated page on
      the same domain does not.  Bare-domain requests get a small
      relaxation — the requested host (with leading `www.' stripped)
      is the substring needle, so opening `https://amazon.ca/' still
      reuses an open tab on `https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B1234'.  A
      route's `:tab-match' overrides the default.

After resolution, if a tab qualifies as already open on the target
client (subject to the route's incognito constraint), the function
focuses it and brings the window forward.  Otherwise a fresh tab is
opened — in an incognito window for incognito routes, in the active
window otherwise.

Compatible with `browse-url-browser-function'; extra arguments are
accepted and ignored."
