;;; Commentary:

;; Adds an `org-babel-execute:browsel-js' function so the user can
;; evaluate JavaScript in the browser's active tab from inside an org
;; source block and capture the return value.
;;
;;   #+begin_src browsel-js
;;   document.querySelector('video').currentTime
;;   #+end_src
;;
;; Header arguments:
;;   :world  "USER_SCRIPT" (default) — isolated world; sees the DOM
;;             but not page-defined globals or functions.  Portable
;;             between Chrome and Firefox.
;;           "MAIN" — page's own `window' / state.  Required for
;;             reading page-framework state (e.g.
;;             `window.ytInitialPlayerResponse') or calling
;;             page-defined functions.  Chrome only — not supported
;;             on Firefox MV2.
;;   :tab-id N — execute in this tab id instead of the active tab.
;;   :frames "all" — return the InjectionResult array for every frame
;;           the script ran in.  Default: the first frame's value.
;;   :client NAME — pick which connected browser runs the block when
;;           more than one is connected (e.g. \"chrome\", \"firefox\").
;;           With one client connected the block runs there
;;           automatically and :client may be omitted.
;;
;; The block's body becomes the JS code passed to
;; `chrome.userScripts.execute'.  As with the EVAL_IN_ACTIVE_TAB handler
;; it requires the user to have toggled "Allow User Scripts" on for the
;; extension at chrome://extensions (Chrome enforces this once per
;; extension).
;;
;; C-c ' opens blocks in js-mode for editing/highlighting.
